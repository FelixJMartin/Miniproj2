SVD-Based Handwritten Digit Classification

This project implements a classification algorithm for handwritten digits using **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**. It was developed as part of a miniproject on pattern recognition and scientific computing.

üîç Project Overview

The goal is to classify grayscale images of handwritten digits (0‚Äì9) using linear algebra techniques, specifically the **SVD** of image matrices. Each image is represented as a vector of 784 values (flattened 28√ó28 pixel grid), and classification is based on projecting new test digits onto low-dimensional subspaces learned from training data.

üß† Method Summary

1. **Training Phase**:
   - For each digit (0‚Äì9), training images are stacked into a matrix.
   - The SVD is computed for each digit-specific matrix.
   - The top `k` singular vectors (`U_k`) are used to define a low-dimensional subspace (digit "signature").

2. **Classification Phase**:
   - Each test digit is compared to all 10 digit subspaces.
   - The digit is assigned to the class whose subspace gives the **smallest residual** in a least-squares sense.

üìä Evaluation

The model is tested on 40,000 test digits using different values of `k` (number of singular vectors), and performance is reported as classification accuracy per digit.

üõ† Technologies Used -------------------

- Python (NumPy, Matplotlib)
- SVD via `numpy.linalg.svd`
- Efficient batch processing with matrix operations

Notes -------------------

- Only the first 400 training images per digit are used for training (due to time/memory constraints).
- The algorithm avoids solving explicit least-squares problems by using the closed-form residual formula:
  
  \[
  \text{residual} = \| (I - U_k U_k^T)\delta \|_2
  \]

- Singular values and "singular images" provide useful insights into the structure of digit classes.
